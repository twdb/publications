Title
=====
Building a statewide lake and drought data hub for Texas using open source tools.

Summary
=======


Abstract
========
This talk is all about waterdatafortexas.org, a new open-source website for
sharing historical and current conditions of the condition of water resources
throughout the state. Interest in the state's water resources has increased
dramatically in the past few years, and this project is an attempt to facilitate
access to information for everyone, from curious citizens to scientists and
specialists. The site is also completely open source, so we hope it will serve
as a grounds for collaboration with fellow developers. With that in mind we'll
take a peek into the design and architecture of the website itself, exploring
the technology stack that the site is built on.

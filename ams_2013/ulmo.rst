Abstract
========

This talk is about Ulmo, an open source python library for clean, simple and
fast access to public hydrology datasets.

Ulmo retrieves and parses datasets from the web.

Ulmo consistently returns simple python data structures that can be easily
pulled into more sophisticated tools for analysis.



Ulmo currently supports CUAHSI WaterOneFlow services, United States Geologic
Survey water web services, National Climatic Data Center Global Summary of the
Day.

Smear: An open source, parallel python toolkit for spatial interpolation of large irregular two-dimensional scattered datasets

Abstract
========

Geophysical datasets collected to study the Earth often come in the form of two-dimensional scattered points to which measurements are attached. Often these datasets have a highly irregular spatial distribution. For example, bathymetric data are often collected at high sample rates along a boat track, but there can be significantly large distances between each boat track. Another example is rain guage networks, where the location of the gauges is often determined by factors like funding and available cooperators. In order to use these datasets in visualization products, simulation models or aggregations to larger spatial units, interpolation is often required to estimate the value of a measurement at unsampled locations. Depending on the properties of the feature being modeled and the spatial distribution of measurements, varying spatial interpolation methods may be appropriate. In many cases, anisotropy may be present and the interpolation algorithm needs to be able to incorporate this anisotropy. An example of this is river channel bed morphology where bathymetric variability is greater transverse to the flow direction than along the flow direction.

Most current spatial interpolation software are commercial and are often accessible only through a GUI interface and are not easily scriptable or extendable. Smear was developed to provide an extendable open source toolkit for spatial interpolation.

Smear utilizes several open source python scientific and GIS libraries to implement several of these algorithms. In addition, it implements a channel following anistropic interpolation algorithm for features where the direction of the anistropy changes in space such as in a river channel. Large datasets are handled efficiently through the use of k-dimensional trees for efficient nieghborhood searches and a parallel implementation based on the IPython parallel architecture allows use of multicore systems and hpc clusters. 

At the Texas Water Development Board, this toolkit has been used to improve lake volume and sediment estimates and to improve the representation of river and channel bathymetry within hydrodynamic models.
